<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the project cost tracking application from an MVP to a feature-rich system. Key work phases included fixing critical frontend API communication issues (missing  prefix and incorrect data payloads), implementing and debugging advanced EVM features (refresh, current date marker), and developing comprehensive payment management with overpayment handling. Subsequently, a full Gantt chart feature was integrated and refined for compactness and information display. The most recent ongoing work involves the addition of a milestone management system, with backend models and API endpoints already successfully implemented and tested. The current focus is on integrating this new milestone functionality into the frontend UI, specifically adding milestone selection to cost entry forms and verifying Gantt chart display. The engineer efficiently utilized troubleshooting agents to overcome persistent syntax errors during development.

<product_requirements>
The application is a project cost tracking system to manage internal/external hours, material, and mechanical costs. It aims to provide comprehensive financial oversight and project management capabilities.
Key features already implemented:
-   **Core Functionality**: Project creation, cost entry (hourly, material, fixed), phase management, custom categories, project listing and deletion.
-   **Dashboard & Visualization**: Budget vs. actual, trends, clickable cost breakdown charts.
-   **Financial Tracking**: Paid vs. outstanding costs, payment status management, outstanding costs timeline, manual payment adjustment with overpayment and partial payment handling.
-   **Usability & Reporting**: Currency localization (â‚¬), data export/import (JSON), PDF export with graphics, internationalization (German/English).
-   **Earned Value Management (EVM)**: Detailed cost estimates, real-time EVM metrics (PV, EV, AC, CPI, SPI, EAC, VAC), visualization of PV, AC, EV, EAC over time, adjusted CPI/EAC with weighted obligations, early warning system, and an EVM refresh button. Project start, end, and current date markers on EVM timeline.
-   **Gantt Chart**: Visual project timeline with phase and task breakdown, progress tracking, budget display, interactive details, and a current date marker. The Gantt chart has been refined for a compact, traditional timeline view with detailed information displayed underneath.
-   **Milestones**: System for creating, managing, and linking costs to milestones, with automatic date synchronization (if milestone date changes, linked cost dates update). Milestones are displayed on the Gantt chart.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: FastAPI (Python backend), React (JavaScript frontend), MongoDB (NoSQL database).
-   **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS, React hooks.
-   **Data Visualization**: Chart.js, React-Chartjs-2.
-   **API Communication**: ,  prefix for backend routes.
-   **Data Models**: Pydantic models for backend data validation.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: React Context for multi-language support.
-   **Earned Value Management (EVM)**: Calculation and visualization of core and adjusted metrics.
-   **Gantt Chart**: Custom implementation for project timeline visualization.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application, defining API endpoints and data models.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive updates throughout the trajectory.
        -   **EVM & Obligations**: Models (, , ) and logic for ,  with weighted obligations and early warning alerts. CRUD API endpoints for obligations (, , , ).
        -   **Cost Entries**: Corrected CostEntry routes.
        -   **Manual Payments**: Added missing  endpoint to update cost amounts for manual payment processing.
        -   **Milestones**: Added  model (with , , , , , ) and CRUD API endpoints (, ). Updated  model to include  and modified  logic to automatically update cost  if  is provided and the milestone's  is later than the cost's .

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing UI, routing, global state, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant modifications across the trajectory.
        -   **API Call Fixes**: Corrected systemic issue where most API calls were missing the  prefix (e.g.,  instead of ). This involved updating local  constant definitions in , , and  components.
        -   **Cost Entry Fixes**: Removed sending extraneous fields (, , ) from frontend to prevent 422 validation errors.
        -   **Manual Payments**: Enhanced  component with Manual Payment buttons,  logic for full, partial, and overpayments, and UI updates for outstanding costs display.
        -   **EVM Refresh**: Added a Refresh EVM button to the EVM metrics section, linking it to the  function.
        -   **Timeline Markers**: Implemented current date marker (vertical green dashed line) on  and later added project start (green), project end (red), and current date (small red dotted) markers to the  chart. Adjusted logic for current date marker in Gantt chart for accurate, color-coded positioning.
        -   **Gantt Chart**: Implemented the  component, adding it to the Actions menu. Redesigned for compactness with a timeline header, horizontal phase bars, and detailed information moved underneath the chart (summary cards, task tables). Added legend for task statuses.
        -   **Milestone Integration**: Added translations for milestone-related terms. Integrated  component and added Manage Milestones option to the Actions menu. Updated  to fetch and display milestones as diamond markers, integrating them into the layout calculation. Updated  component to include a dropdown for milestone selection (this part is still in progress).

-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  (implied by previous analysis, though trajectory shows  which is likely related) and potentially other dependencies for chart and UI enhancements.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages backend Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to support new features (e.g., ,  for PDF, and other dependencies implied by new models).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Milestone Integration**: Add milestone dropdown to cost entry forms for linking costs to milestones.
-   **UI Testing (Milestone Manager)**: Test the milestone management interface in the frontend.
-   **Gantt Chart Milestone Display**: Verify that milestone diamond markers are displayed correctly on the Gantt chart.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a comprehensive milestone system for the application. The backend work for this feature has been fully completed and verified. This includes:
-   **Backend Model Definition**: A new  model has been defined, capturing attributes like , , , , , and .
-   **Backend API Endpoints**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for milestones have been implemented in . These endpoints allow for managing milestones efficiently.
-   **Cost-Milestone Linking**: The  model in the backend has been updated to include a  field. Crucially, the  logic now supports automatic date synchronization: if a cost is linked to a milestone and the milestone's  is later than the cost's , the cost's  will automatically be updated to match the milestone's .
-   **Backend Verification**: Extensive testing () has confirmed that all backend milestone functionalities, including CRUD operations, date synchronization, and critical path support, are working correctly.

On the frontend, the work has begun with:
-   **Translations**: Necessary language translations for milestone-related terms have been added.
-   **MilestoneManager Component**: A new  React component has been created.
-   **Navigation Integration**: The Manage Milestones option has been added to the Actions menu in the frontend, and the application's routing logic has been updated to render the  component when this option is selected.
-   **Gantt Chart Integration**: The  component has been updated to fetch and display milestones as diamond markers, and the layout calculation has been adjusted to accommodate them.

The immediate next step is to complete the frontend integration for milestone selection within the cost entry forms.
